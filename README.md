Arduino Test Platform - Sourcemeter

This projects is about making a cheap, accurate and simple to build sourcemeter as a substitute for professional SMU (source-measure-units)

The board design is based on a MCP3424 4CH ADC with upto 18 bit resolution, a MCP4728 4CH DAC with 12bit resolution and a TLV4113 2CH high-power OP-AMP (>200mA) 

This repository contaions a description of the design idea (powerpoint), layout files for the PCB (eagle) and the software for the arduino and a GUI application for interfacing.
